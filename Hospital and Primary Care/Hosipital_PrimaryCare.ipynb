    "# Finding the Best Pittsburgh Neighborhood to Survive a Zombie Apocalypse\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to identify the best Pittsburgh neighborhood to survive a zombie apocalypse based on proximity to hospitals and primary care access. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following datasets for our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PGHSNAP - Neighborhood Census Data\n",
    "2. Allegheny County Hospitals\n",
    "3. Allegheny County Primary Care Access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Importing Libraries and Loading Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the necessary libraries (pandas, NumPy, geopy) and load the datasets using pandas' `read_csv()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before analyzing the data, we clean and preprocess it, which may include removing missing values, filtering out irrelevant columns, and extracting latitude and longitude information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Calculating Distances to Hospitals and Primary Care Facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `geopy.distance.great_circle()` function, we calculate the distance from each neighborhood to the nearest hospital and primary care facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Scoring System\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a scoring system that assigns higher scores to neighborhoods with shorter distances to hospitals and primary care facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Finding the Best Neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "By sorting the neighborhoods based on their survival scores, we identify the best neighborhood for surviving a zombie apocalypse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "We use matplotlib to create the following visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bar Plot**: The top 10 neighborhoods with the highest survival scores\n",
    "2. **Scatter Plot**: The neighborhoods, hospitals, and primary care facilities in Pittsburgh\n",
    "3. **Heatmap**: The survival scores of Pittsburgh neighborhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this analysis, we have identified the best Pittsburgh neighborhood to survive a zombie apocalypse based on proximity to hospitals and primary care access. The visualizations help us better understand the analysis results and present our findings.\n"
