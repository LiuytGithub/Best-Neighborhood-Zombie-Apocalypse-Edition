**Description:** 
Finding the best Pittsburgh neighborhood to survive in during a zombie apocalypse based on:
- Access to grocery stores and convenience stores (gotta stock up on those canned goods!)  
- Population Density (more people = more potential zombies to fight)   
- Access to hospitals and Primary Care Access(very convenient for pillaging medical supplies)
