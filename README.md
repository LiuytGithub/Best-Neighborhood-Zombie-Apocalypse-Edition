**Description:** 
Finding the best Pittsburgh neighborhood to survive in during a zombie apocalypse based on:
- Number of grocery stores (gotta stock up on those canned goods!)  
- Population Density (more people = more potential zombies to fight)  
- Proximity to green space/forests (lose those brain-hungry stalkers amongst some thick foliage!)  
    - forests/parks are a great place to find useful materials like wood, rocks(?), pine cones(??), etc.  
    - You can also forage or hunt for meals too-- berries, dandelions, deer, um... squirrels   
- Proximity to hospitals and Primary Care Access(very convenient for pillaging medical supplies)
