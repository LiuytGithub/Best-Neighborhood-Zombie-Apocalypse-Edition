We wanted to have as much fun as possible (for a final project haha), and after throwing around a few ideas, we ended on **ZOMBIES**. When consider what approach to take and what aspects we wanted to quantify for best neighborhood, we decided upon:\n",

    "* population density\n",
    "\n",
    "as some of the most important factors to survival. Food is obviously crucial for stamina and the upkeep of one's health and energy. Medical supplies are important for tending to wounds and keeping infections at bay. And finally, while we cannot get out of the city, we would like to reduce the number of individuals around us for safety reasons. In the brainstorming process, we considered looking into:\n",
